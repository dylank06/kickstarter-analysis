# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  The Kickstarting with Excel project aims at drawing conclusions based off of the raw data that has been collected on successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters. 
  
### Purpose
  The purpose of the Kickstarting with excel project was to discover the relvant trends with kickstarters to be able to have more knowledge on what factors contribute to a successful kickstarter. 
  
## Analysis and Challenges
  There are several different ways to draw conclusions on the kickstarter data. One of the most compelling data points was how succesful kickstarters were based on the launch date. Theater, music, and technology categories had the most startups. The music category had the highest success rate for startups. The theater category had the most startups and most of those being plays. While the technology category had a much lower success rate. The least succesful categories were journalism, technology, publishing, and food. The most challenging part of the project was getting my excel to run while using large amounts of data. The further I got into the project the more my excel application started to crash.
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates  
  The most potent visualsation of the project was the result of outcomes based on launch dates. The graph shows that startups trend up and peak in May and after slope down gradulally each month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The trend line on the analysis based on goals shows the higher the goal the less likely for it to be met. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  I had difficulties using Chountifs and formating my graph how it is shown on the module.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    First, the best month to launch a start up is in May. The later in the year the likely hood of success drops. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The lower goal that is set the more likely it is to be reached. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Having broad variables like launch date and categories
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Have more specific variables like education or levels of experience for starups.
